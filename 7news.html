        <span>Earlier today, a Los Angeles local man was found dead in his apartment after a police visitation prompted by a CivicSight alert. Henry Jones, 28, was recorded last night violently assaulting an unnamed man at a houseparty through a CivicSight residential surveillance program camera. Police believe that this was a suicide, prompted by the CivicSight alert. Initial reports indicate that Jones was unaware of any CivicSight cameras at the houseparty, raising questions about the need for disclosure of residential CivicSight cameras. </span>
