            <span><i>MR. JONES enters MR. FINCH'S dwelling.</i></span>
            <span>MR. JONES: Hey man, what's up! It's been ages I swear to god.</span>
            <span>MR. FINCH: Woah, look who it is. Glad to see you could make it.</span>
            <span>MR JONES: Yeah, much happier to come along if it's in here. Don't fuck with those cams, yknow?</span>
            <span><i>Awkward laughter from MR. FINCH.</i></span>
            <span>MR. FINCH: Yeah, I get what you mean. Though they have been pretty good at getting crime down.</span>
            <span>MR. JONES: Careful Jesse, you're starting to sound like you enjoy being snooped on.</span>
            <span><i>MR. JONES laughs and shakes his head.</i></span>
            <span>MR. FINCH: Hey, screw off. It's not that bad.</span>
            <span>MR JONES: No but for real man, they're bad news.</span>
            <span><i>MR. FINCH shrugs.</i></span>
            <span>MR FINCH: Sure, yep.</span>
            <span>MR. JONES: Yeah. I'm gonna go say hi to everyone else.</span>
