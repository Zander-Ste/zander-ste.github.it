            <span><i>MR. JONES and MR. LIU enter the bedroom mid-conversation.</i></span>
            <span>MR. JONES: -and I'm telling you, it's a bad system. </span>
            <span>MR. LIU: It's not, if you do the right thing. You've got no reason to be concerned Henry!</span>
            <span>MR. JONES: It's not about what I have and haven't done, it's about knowing everything I do is being constantly watched.</span>
            <span>MR. LIU: But you don't have to be worried if you just don't do the wrong thing.</span>
            <span>MR. JONES: You keep saying that, Simon. But that's not the point!</span>
            <span><i>MR. JONES raises his voice, almost shouting.</i></span>
            <span>MR. LIU: Well maybe it should be!</span>
            <span><i>MR. LIU crosses his arms and faces MR. JONES.</i></span>
            <span>MR. LIU: I started a new position with CivicSight last month. I promise Henry, it really is good.</span>
            <span>MR. JONES: You what? How could you!</span>
            <span>MR. LIU: Because it keeps people safe! It's protecting the public.</span>
            <span>MR. JONES: At the cost of privacy! At the cost of people who can't afford to pay for a meal!</span>
            <span><i>MR. JONES shoves MR. LIU, hitting his head against the bedframe.</i></span>
            <span>MR. JONES: Shitâ€¦</span>
            <span><i>MR. LIU does not move. MR. JONES exits the room.</i></span>
