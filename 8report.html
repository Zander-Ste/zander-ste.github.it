                <span class="line-text"><strong>ADJUDICATOR KINGS:</strong> Good morning, everyone. Please be seated. We are here today to discuss the CivicSight residential surveillance program and the need for disclosure. Ms. Sharpe, could you please introduce the relevant context for those in the room who might be unfamiliar?</span>

                <span class="line-number">2</span>
                <span class="line-text"><strong>MS. SHARPE:</strong> Thank you Mr. Kings. Several days ago, an altercation occured at a house party in which one party was greviously injured, and remains hospitalised. The assailent was not initally aware of CivicSight cameras inside the house, and when he was informed of their presence and the subsequent recording of his crimes, he took his own life in a panic.</span>

                <span class="line-text"><strong>MR. HARRIS:</strong> Currently, CivicSight recommends disclosure, but does not require it for participants in the program.</span>

                <span class="line-text"><strong>ADJUDICATOR KINGS:</strong> Does CivicSight state a reason for not enforcing disclosure, Mr. Harris?</span>

                <span class="line-number">6</span>
                <span class="line-text"><strong>MR. HARRIS:</strong> Yes. Many people who choose to opt in to the program do so because they are experiencing forms of domestic abuse, which might not be identified should the location of CivicSight cameras be disclosed.</span>
