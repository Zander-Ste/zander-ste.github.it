        <p>Created in 2039, CivicSight is a public security system that utilises a cross-country camera network, facial recognition software and pattern recognition algorithms to accurately identify and penalise crime as soon as it occurs. Proven to reduce crime rates per year by upwards of 70%, CivicSight has been a success since implementation by the United States Government. However, while CivicSight has primarily replaced the judicial and legal system, it has limitations on cases relating to important legal officials, foreign policy and CivicSight functions.</p>
        <br>
